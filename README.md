# Zip-To-MP4
A console app to generate an mp4 video file from a zip file, and also regenerate back the zip from such an mp4 file.

## How to use

Build and run the ZipToMP4.cpp file. You will get two options:

1. To generate .mp4 from a .zip file.
2. To regenerate a .zip file from a .mp4 file.

After this, you will get a prompt to enter the path of the file (either .zip or .mp4, depending on your requirement).
On pressing enter, the program will generate the required file along with a binary version of it at that same path.
